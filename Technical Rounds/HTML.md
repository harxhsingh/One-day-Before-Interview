28. How do you add CSS styling in HTML?
There are three ways to include the CSS with HTML:

Inline CSS: It is used when less amount of styling is needed or in cases where only a single element has to be styled. To use inline styles add the style attribute in the relevant tag.
External Style Sheet: This is used when the style is applied to many elements or HTML pages. Each page must link to the style sheet using the <link> tag:
<head>

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css" />

</head>

Internal Style Sheet: It is used when a single HTML document has a unique style and several elements need to be styled to follow the format. Internal styles sheet is added in the head section of an HTML page, by using the <style> tag:
<head>

  <style type="text/css">

    hr {

      color: sienna;

    }

    p {

      margin-left: 20px;

    }

  </style>

30. How do you add JavaScript to an HTML webpage?
JavaScript is used for making HTML web pages more interactive, and user-friendly. It is a scripting language that allows you to interact with certain elements on the page, based on user input. As with CSS, there are three major ways of including JavaScript:

Inline:
You can add JavaScript to your HTML elements directly whenever a certain event occurs. We can add the JavaScript code using attributes of the HTML tags that support it. Here is an example that shows an alert with a message when the user clicks on it:

<button onclick="alert('Click the Button!');">

Click!

</button>

Script block:
You can define a script block anywhere on the HTML code, which will get executed as soon as the browser reaches that part of the document. This is why script blocks are usually added at the bottom of HTML documents.

<html>

  <script>

    var x = 1;

    var y = 2;

    var result = x + y;

    alert("X + Y is equal to " + result);

  </script>

</html>

External JavaScript file:
You can also import the JavaScript code from a separate file and keep your HTML code clutter-free. This is especially useful if there is a large amount of scripting added to an HTML webpage.

<html>

  <script src="my-script.js"></script>

</html>
